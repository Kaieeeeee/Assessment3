# Assessment 3 - Mint, Burn, and Transfer

## Description
For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you should be able to interact with it for your walk-through video. 
From your chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

Upload your solution to GitHub and share the link with us along with a quick code walk-through as explained below.

### Functions
- **mint**: mint/add/input any amount.
- **burn**: burn/delete/withdraw any amount.
- **transfer**: transfer already minted amount.

#### Getting Started
1. To execute this you will need Remix. https://remix.ethereum.org/

2. Copy the code then paste it on remix! viola! (Remember to put .sol at the end)

Other notes: 

The code does not work on my end with pragma 0.8.18, I used pragma  0.8.26.

I also used Remix instead of Gitpod since it is not working on my end.
